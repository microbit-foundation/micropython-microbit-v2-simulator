Thanks for looking here! We'd love your help. The micro:bit project is only
possible through contributions of companies and individuals around the world.

This project is managed on GitHub, and the best way to contribute is to jump in
and fix/file issues.

Significant features are best discussed first to make sure everyone is agreed
on the best direction.

The project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format TypeScript code so
please check out their documentation and set it up with your code editor.
